<h1 class="page-title">CRISTIANO RONALDO BIOGRAPHY</h1>
<p class="pages-paragraph">Early life and career
        Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment 
        manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was 
        added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite
        movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the 
        time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed
        with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was
        sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first
        played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then
        transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting
        Lisbon), where he played for that club’s 
        various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first
         team in 2002.</p>
<h2>Iternation Career</h2>
<p>On his home soil, after moving through the youth and
        under-21 ranks, Ronaldo had made his first appearance for
        Portugal’s full national team against Kazakhstan in
        August 2003 (four days after his debut for United).
        He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish
        at the 2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain 
        of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play
        led Portugal to the semifinals of the European 
        Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival 
        Spain in a match that was decided by a penalty kick
        shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of 
        his second world player of the year win, but his play at the 
        tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team struggled 
        during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal
        win the European Championship, the country’s first major
        international tournament title, although he only played 
         paringly in the final because of a knee injury that he
        had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly
        at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games
        as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose its first match of 
        that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side. Four years later Ronaldo became 
        the first male player to score at five different World Cups. However, he was
        not part of the starting lineup for several games, and Portugal’s
         2022 World Cup ended with a loss in the quarterfinals.</p>

<h2>Endorsements and legal issues</h2>
<p>Ronaldo was one of the most well-known sports stars off the field, and numerous studies of athletes’ 
        popularity showed that he was the most-beloved athlete in the world during his playing peak. His extreme popularity 
        made Ronaldo one of the highest-paid endorsers in sports history, and in November 2016 he became the third person
        (after basketball superstars Michael Jordan and LeBron James) to earn a “lifetime” contract from the sportswear company
        Nike. Moreover, he established his own successful “CR7” brand of products that included shoes, underwear, and fragrances. Ronaldo’s 
        immense marketability was at the centre of a legal issue that arose in June 2017. That month prosecutors 
        filed a lawsuit that accused Ronaldo of defrauding the Spanish government of €14.7 million ($16.5 million) 
        by hiding his image-rights income in Spain from 2011 to 2014. He was accused of having underestimated the
        income he earned from the sale and licensing of his image rights and the accompanying tax obligations, 
        but Ronaldo denied all allegations. However, in June 2018 he accepted a
        suspended two-year prison sentence and agreed to pay €18.8 million ($21.8 million) to the Spanish government to settle the case.</p>
